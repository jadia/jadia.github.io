# [jadia.dev](https://jadia.dev) 

The blog theme is a fork of [diamantidis.github.io](https://diamantidis.github.io). 
I am thankful to [Ioannis Diamantidis](https://twitter.com/diamantidis_io) for making the blog code open source. All the credit for initial repository setup goes to him.

This is the repository for my [personal blog]. 

The whole site is open source, meaning that all the code that runs on the live site is here. 


## Under the hood

This blog is built with [Jekyll], an open source static site generator. The content is written in [Markdown] files, which Jekyll turns into HTML. The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages], a free web hosting service provided by [GitHub]. 

The repository has two main branches: [`source`] and [`master`]. The `source` branch contains the Jekyll project while the `master` branch contains the final version of the site, as it is served on [`jadia.dev`].

On every PR against the `source` branch, a `Travis CI` job runs using [Danger] and [Danger-prose] to perform a check for typos and lint prose. When the PR is approved and merged to `source`, a  `GitHub Actions` workflow builds the Jekyll project and push the generated site onto the `master` branch.
