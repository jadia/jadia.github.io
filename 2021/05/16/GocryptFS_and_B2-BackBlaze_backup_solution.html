Most of the older data was recovered from my backup HDDs, but I lost the recent data which was not present in the backup HDDs. The data loss included a part of my master’s thesis, photos taken in 2019 and a lot of code which I did not publish on Github. This happened because I was too lazy to copy the data to my external backup hard disk and sort it.</p> <p>This incident made me buy multiple hard disks for better redundancy but from past 2 years I’ve been manually coping data to and from the backup drives. These drives also contain a lot of sensitive data hence I had to keep them physically safe from others.</p> <p>Inspired by this article, <a href="https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/how-i-store-my-files-and-why-you-should-not-rely-on-fancy-tools-for-backup.html">Don’t use fancy tools</a>, I’ve decided to come up with a backup solution for myself which I will cover in some other post. This post aims to be a guide on backing up the most critical and sensitive data to the cloud.</p> <p>Solutions like Google Drive, OneDrive or Dropbox are great but they are too expensive for my use case. I want a Cloud storage where I can simply upload and forget, only access it in case something happens to my backup hard disks. <br /> Object storage, specifically <strong>BlackBlaze B2</strong>, <em>seems</em> to be a good for long term backup.</p> <p>Back in 2010, I use to create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.zip</code> files of the data I wanted to protect, but now given the size of data and possibility of a large single file getting corrupted I’ve decided to go with <strong>GoCryptFS</strong> as the encryption program. <br /> It is crucial to have your personal files encrypted when stored on the cloud, you never know about another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICloud_leaks_of_celebrity_photos">iCloud hack.</a>.</p> <h3 id="what-is-backblaze-b2-cloud-storage">What is Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage?</h3> <p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/object-storage">According to IBM</a>, object storage is a data storage architecture for handling large amounts of <strong>unstructured data</strong> such as video, photos, audio files, documents, sensor data, etc. In the object storage the data is stored in a structurally flat data environment and the hierarchical filesystem model is not followed.</p> <p>On the inside, each object include data and it’s metadata information such as unique ID number instead of file names or path. <br /> The best part of object storage is the pay-as-you-go structure, where we have to pay only the amount of storage used. It also offers virtually unlimited storage.</p> <p>AWS S3 and Backblaze B2, both are object storage. Upon price comparison you’ll find that Backblaze B2 is significantly cheaper than AWS S3. That is why we are selecting B2 as our storage option.</p> <p><img src="/assets/posts/2021-05-16-GocryptFS_and_B2-BackBlaze_backup_solution/2021-08-15-03-25-53.png" alt="Storage options" /></p> <h3 id="what-is-rclone">What is Rclone?</h3> <p>Rclone is a powerful and actively managed open-source command line program written in GoLang. It is generally used to manage files on cloud storage. It covers various types of storage options such as Dropbox, Google drive, AWS S3, etc.</p> <blockquote> <p>Users call rclone <em>“The Swiss army knife of cloud storage”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>It has various features such as file harsh verification to maintain data integrity, sync files between local and the cloud storage, check the hashes for missing/extra files, <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone-webui-react">a beautiful web based GUI</a>, etc.</p> <p>In our use-case, we need something which might keep my cloud storage in sync with the local changes. That is why we’ll mostly use the <strong>sync</strong> option.</p> <h3 id="what-is-gocryptfs">What is GoCryptFS?</h3> <p>When you wish to store something sensitive either on the cloud or in a external disk, it’s advised to encrypt the content before it hits the cloud servers/HDD.</p> <p><a href="https://nuetzlich.net/gocryptfs/">According to the project’s webpage</a>, GoCryptFS uses file-based encryption that is implemented as a mountable FUSE filesystem. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace">Filesystem in USErspace (FUSE)</a> is a software interface for Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems that lets non-privileged users create their own file systems without editing kernel code. For GoCryptFS this means that on disk the files will be stored in encrypted format, but when mounted and a correct password is provided, these files are accessible in unencrypted form.</p> <p>The encrypted files can be stored in any folder on your hard disk, a USB stick or even inside the Dropbox folder. One advantage of file-based encryption as opposed to disk encryption is that encrypted files can be synchronised efficiently using standard tools like Dropbox or rsync.</p> <p>The only fear I have of using GoCryptFS is being locked out of my files due to some issues like the program might not be actively maintained in the future or a file might get corrupt while getting encrypted.</p> <p>Despite all this as of now, GoCryptFS is the best file level encryption tool.</p> <h3 id="install-gocryptfs-and-rclone">Install GoCryptFS and Rclone</h3> <p>The post will assume that you have Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS installed on your system.<br /> As of writing this post, I have following version of GoCryptFS: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gocryptfs 1.7.1; go-fuse 0.0~git20190214.58dcd77; 2019-12-26 go1.13.5 linux/amd64</code></p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">-y</span> gocryptfs
