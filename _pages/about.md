Hi! I’m Nitish Jadia, currently working at [Invesco (India)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/invesco-ltd) as a full-stack developer where I enjoy solving problems - big or small and love being involved in every part of the product development. I mostly write Python and love working on APIs and DevOps-y stuff.   
I’m interested in backend, containers, distributed systems, monitoring and software in general, and I love to write blog posts about them.    

I'm an alumnus of the School of Computer and Information Science (SCIS), University of Hyderabad where along with my Master’s degree, I also got an opportunity to work as a Systems Administrator.    

In my free time, I like to tinker with Raspberry Pi, skill up with certifications, read books, and often binge-watch Netflix.
When I’m not on my computer, you can find me attending tech meetups, lifting weights and taking photographs.
