The Internet is already a scary place with bad people all over the place. It’s risky to allow a vulnerable Raspberry Pi running inside your home which is accessible from the Internet. Once, <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/nasa-hack-used-a-raspberry-pi\">a rouge Raspberry Pi resulted in NASA hack</a>, beware!</p>\n\n<p>The diagram below shows how port forwarding punches a hole into your router.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/2021-08-15-Expose_Raspberry_Pi_to_the_Internet_using_Cloudflare_Tunnel/2021-08-17-01-56-46.png\" alt=\"Port forwarding\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-are-cloudflare-tunnels\">What are Cloudflare Tunnels?</h2>\n\n<p>Recently, Cloudflare made a <em>boring</em> <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/tunnel-for-everyone/\">announcement</a> about offering Cloudflare tunnels (formally, <em>Argo Tunnels</em>) for free!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cloudflare Tunnels</strong> create an encrypted tunnel between your server and the Cloudflare network using the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cloudflared</code> daemon.\nBecause of this, users won’t directly connect to your server, instead they will connect via proxy through Cloudflare’s network.</p>\n\n<p>This takes away a lot of steps involved in exposing your server from the home.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>There is no need to open any ports on your network. To the outside world and even your ISP, your server just looks like any other encrypted web traffic.</li>\n  <li>There is no need to create, buy or mange TLS certificates as <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cloudflared</code> handles all of this for you.</li>\n  <li>Cloudflare utilizes smart routing to speed up traffic latency. They avoid congested network and high latency area which routing the traffic through their edge network.</li>\n  <li>You get a WAF and DDOS protection built in.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@durksauce/self-hosting-with-raspberry-pi-and-argo-tunnels-11f06d1309a9\">Source</a></p>\n\n<p>In the diagram below the user can only access the <em>origin</em>(server) through the Cloudflare’s network but not directly.\nThis will provide us an extra layer of security by hiding our origin source and as well as prevent bad actors from accessing\nthe website directly.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/2021-08-15-Expose_Raspberry_Pi_to_the_Internet_using_Cloudflare_Tunnel/2021-08-17-01-50-56.png\" alt=\"cloudflared tunnel representation\" /></p>\n\n<p>Later, I might also take a look into <a href=\"https://github.com/fatedier/frp\">frp: Fast Reverse Proxy</a>, but as on now I’ll stick to Cloudflare Tunnels.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-tunnels-work\">How Tunnels work?</h3>\n\n<p>The HTTP tunnels are always initiated from the client side. Here, the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cloudflared</code> daemon will initiate the connection\nto the Cloudflare’s network. My university network would not allow port-forwarding or allow any outside traffic to connect directly.\nThis client side initiation of the connection would help bypass such roadblocks. A single long lived connection is \nestablished where many logical sockets are created within one physical socket connection. This method is called Multiplexing.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/23397564\">Source: How ngrok works?</a>  <br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/inconshreveable/ngrok/blob/master/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#network-protocol-and-tunneling\">Source: Overview of how ngrok tunneling works</a></p>\n\n<p>This is similar to <a href=\"http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_TCPIPProcessesMultiplexingandClientServerApplicati-2.htm\">TCP multiplexing</a>, where a host with a single TCP connection can manage communication between multiple processes.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/2021-07-30-Expose_Raspberry_Pi_to_the_Internet_using_Cloudflare_Tunnel/2021-08-15-21-01-33.png\" alt=\"Source: http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/diagrams/portsmultiplexing.png\" /></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/tunnel-for-everyone/\">According to Cloudflare</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With Tunnel, users can create a private link from their origin server directly to Cloudflare without a publicly routable IP address. Instead, this private connection is established by running a lightweight daemon, cloudflared, on your origin, which creates a secure, outbound-only connection. This means that only traffic that routes through Cloudflare can reach your origin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tunnel secures your origin by making outbound-only connections to Cloudflare.

This post aims to be a guide on backing up the most critical and sensitive data to the cloud.</p>\n\n<p>Solutions like Google Drive, OneDrive or Dropbox are great but they are too expensive for my use case. I want a Cloud storage\nwhere I can simply upload and forget, only access it in case something happens to my backup hard disks. <br />\nObject storage, specifically <strong>BlackBlaze B2</strong>, <em>seems</em> to be a good for long term backup.</p>\n\n<p>Back in 2010, I use to create a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.zip</code> files of the data I wanted to protect, but now given the size of data and possibility of a large single file getting corrupted I’ve decided to go with <strong>GoCryptFS</strong> as the encryption program. <br />\nIt is crucial to have your personal files encrypted when stored on the cloud, you never know about another <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICloud_leaks_of_celebrity_photos\">iCloud hack.</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-backblaze-b2-cloud-storage\">What is Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage?</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/object-storage\">According to IBM</a>, object storage is a data storage architecture\nfor handling large amounts of <strong>unstructured data</strong> such as video, photos, audio files, documents, sensor data, etc.\nIn the object storage the data is stored in a structurally flat data environment and the hierarchical filesystem model\nis not followed.</p>\n\n<p>On the inside, each object include data and it’s metadata information such as unique ID number instead of file names\nor path. <br />\nThe best part of object storage is the pay-as-you-go structure, where we have to pay only the amount of storage \nused. It also offers virtually unlimited storage.</p>\n\n<p>AWS S3 and Backblaze B2, both are object storage. Upon price comparison you’ll find that Backblaze B2 is significantly\ncheaper than AWS S3. That is why we are selecting B2 as our storage option.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/2021-05-16-GocryptFS_and_B2-BackBlaze_backup_solution/2021-08-15-03-25-53.png\" alt=\"Storage options\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-rclone\">What is Rclone?</h3>\n\n<p>Rclone is a powerful and actively managed open-source command line program written in GoLang.\nIt is generally used to manage files on cloud storage. It covers various types of storage options such as Dropbox,\nGoogle drive, AWS S3, etc.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Users call rclone <em>“The Swiss army knife of cloud storage”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It has various features such as file harsh verification to maintain data integrity, sync files between local\nand the cloud storage, check the hashes for missing/extra files, <a href=\"https://github.com/rclone/rclone-webui-react\">a beautiful web based GUI</a>, etc.</p>\n\n<p>In our use-case, we need something which might keep my cloud storage in sync with the local changes.\nThat is why we’ll mostly use the <strong>sync</strong> option.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-gocryptfs\">What is GoCryptFS?</h3>\n\n<p>When you wish to store something sensitive either on the cloud or in a external disk,\nit’s advised to encrypt the content before it hits the cloud servers/HDD.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nuetzlich.net/gocryptfs/\">According to the project’s webpage</a>, GoCryptFS uses file-based encryption that is implemented as a mountable FUSE filesystem. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace\">Filesystem in USErspace (FUSE)</a> is a software interface for Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems that lets non-privileged users create their own file systems without editing kernel code. For GoCryptFS this means that on disk the files \nwill be stored in encrypted format, but when mounted and a correct password is provided, these files are \naccessible in unencrypted form.</p>\n\n<p>The encrypted files can be stored in any folder on your hard disk, a USB stick or even inside the Dropbox folder. One advantage of file-based encryption as opposed to disk encryption is that encrypted files can be synchronised efficiently using standard tools like Dropbox or rsync.</p>\n\n<p>The only fear I have of using GoCryptFS is being locked out of my files due to some issues like the program might not be actively maintained in the future or a file might get corrupt while getting encrypted.</p>\n\n<p>Despite all this as of now, GoCryptFS is the best file level encryption tool.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"install-gocryptfs-and-rclone\">Install GoCryptFS and Rclone</h3>\n\n<p>The post will assume that you have Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS installed on your system.<br />\nAs of writing this post, I have following version of GoCryptFS:\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gocryptfs 1.7.1; go-fuse 0.0~git20190214.58dcd77; 2019-12-26 go1.13.5 linux/amd64</code></p>\n\n<div class=\"language-bash highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"nb\">sudo </span>apt <span class=\"nb\">install</span> <span class=\"nt\">-y</span> gocryptfs\ncurl https://rclone.org/install.sh | <span class=\"nb\">sudo </span>bash\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3 id=\"configure-the-object-storage-with-rclone\">Configure the Object Storage with Rclone</h3>\n\n<p>Register at <a href=\"https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html\">https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html</a>.

Create and configure a custom service account that has the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/hardening-your-cluster#use_least_privilege_sa\">minimum IAM roles</a> that are required by all the Pods running in the cluster.</p>\n\n  <p>This approach is not compatible with <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/sandbox-pods\">GKE Sandbox</a> because GKE Sandbox blocks access to the metadata server.</p>\n\n  <h3 id=\"service-account-json-key\"><strong>Service Account JSON key</strong></h3>\n\n  <p>A third way to grant credentials for Google Cloud resources to applications is to manually use the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys\">service account’s key</a>. This approach is strongly discouraged because of the difficulty of securely managing account keys.</p>\n\n  <p>You should use <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/authenticating-to-cloud-platform\">application-specific Google Cloud service accounts to provide credentials</a> so that applications have the minimal necessary permissions. Each service account is assigned only the IAM roles that are needed for its paired application to operate successfully. Keeping the service account application-specific makes it easier to revoke its access in the case of a compromise without affecting other applications. Once you have assigned your service account the correct IAM roles, you can create a JSON service account key, and then mount that into your Pod using a Kubernetes <a

The reversal of transaction will be computationally impractical unless more than 50% of nodes are not intending to attack the network.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"transactions\">Transactions</h3>\n\n<p>Each transaction is clubbed with the hash of the previous transaction and public key of next owner then signed by the person making this transaction. This forms a chain of transactions. This chain of digital signatures are called electronic coin.\nSolving double spending problem without any mediating third-party requires a node to be aware of all the transactions.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>The transactions must be publicly announced.</li>\n  <li>All participants must agree on a single chronological order of all transactions.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"timestamp-server\">Timestamp Server</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/bitcoin-whitepaper/timestamp.png\" alt=\"Bitcoin timestamp\" />\nTimestamp server generates a hash of the current block, it also includes timestamp of previous block, hence forming a chain.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"proof-of-work\">Proof of work</h3>\n\n<p>The Proof-of-Work[PoW] involves guessing a nounce value which can generate a hash which starts with a required amount on zero bits. The block cannot be changed without redoing the work. This implies that to modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the PoW for that block and all the blocks after it. Average work required is exponential in the number of zero bits required. PoW difficulty increases if blocks are being generated too fast.</p>\n\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Y=H ( X || k )</code></p>\n\n<p>There exist no efficient algorithm to find value of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">k</code>(nounce).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"network\">Network</h3>\n\n<p>New transactions are broadcasted to all nodes, all the nodes collect new transactions into a block and try to find PoW for that block. When PoW is found, the block is broadcasted to all the nodes. The block is accepted by the nodes if all the transactions in the block are valid and not already spent. The hash of the accepted block is considered as previous hash.\nNodes always consider longest chain to be the correct one and work on extending it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"incentive\">Incentive</h3>\n\n<p>Just like gold miners adding gold to the circulation, the bitcoin miners too get paid as block reward when they are successful in their PoW, that means, with each new block, the bitcoin in the economy increases.The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees.\nThe first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"saving-disk-space\">Saving disk space</h3>\n\n<p>Instead of storing whole Merkle Tree, we can stubbing off the branches off the tree and keeping the block header with no transactions. The hash value in the block header keeps the integrity of all its sub-branches and transactions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"payment-verification\">Payment Verification</h3>\n\n<p>A transaction can be verified by a user without running a full node network. It just has to keep a copy of block headers of the longest PoW chain. The user cannot check for validity of the transaction by himself because he won’t be having all the transactions with himself. He can just see that the transaction is a part of longest chain and this confirms that the transaction is valid. Verification requires executing only single hash.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"privacy\">Privacy</h3>\n\n<p>Privacy can be maintained by keeping public keys anonymous. It is advisable to use a new key pair for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"security\">Security</h3>\n\n<p>An attack can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent. The probability of a survival of a dishonest chain is fairly low.</p>\n",
